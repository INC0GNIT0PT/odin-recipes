 <h2>Description</h2>
 <p>Pasta Bolognese is a classic Italian dish that is actually very easy to make at home! 
     With a handful of ingredients and 30 minutes of time, 
     you'll have a complex sauce that's perfect over pasta and can even be used in 
     other Italian dishes, such as <a href="./lasagna.html">lasagne</a>.</p>
    
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    <li>125g pancetta finely diced</li>
    <li>500g ground beef I use 90% lean</li>
    <li>3/4 cup onion finely diced</li>
    <li>1/2 cup carrot peeled and finely diced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons garlic minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 cup red wine</li>
    <li>250g can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>800g can crushed tomatoes do not drain</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1/4 cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>350g spaghetti</li>
    <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese grated</li>
    <li>1/4 cup basil leaves thinly sliced</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the pancetta and cook for 4-5 minutes until browned and crispy.</li>
    <li>Add the ground beef to the pan and season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook for 5 minutes, breaking up the beef into small pieces with a spatula.</li>
    <li>Add the onion and carrot to the pan. Cook for 4-5 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Add the garlic and Italian seasoning, then cook for 30 seconds. Drain off any excess grease.</li>
    <li>Add the red wine to the pot and bring to a simmer. Cook for 3-4 minutes or until wine is reduced by half.</li>
    <li>Stir in the tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes. Season the sauce with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Bring the sauce to a simmer. Cook for 25-30 minutes or until sauce has thickened.</li>
    <li>Stir in the heavy cream and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Cook the spaghetti in salted water according to package directions. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta cooking water.</li>
    <li>Pour the pasta in with the sauce and toss to combine. If the sauce is too thick, add a little pasta cooking water to thin it out.</li>
    <li>Top the pasta with basil and parmesan cheese, then serve immediately.</li>
