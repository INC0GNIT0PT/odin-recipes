      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Beloura, bolacho, farinhato, pilouco ou bica are the different names given to this delicacy from traditional 
          Portuguese cuisine, more specifically from the Minho region in northern 
          Portugal.</p>
      <p>Belouras are made from wheat, maize and rye flour, 
          mixed with pig's blood and seasoned with strong spices. 
          They should always be cut into thin slices, fried and served immediately, 
          piping hot.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, belouras are part of the recipe for 
          <a href="./rojoes_a_moda_do_minho.html">Rojões à moda do Minho</a>,
          but they are an excellent accompaniment to other dishes or appetisers.</p>
