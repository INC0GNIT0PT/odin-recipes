With this project i will practice all of the HTML knowledge you have acquired with odin project until yet.
Here i am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
The website won’t look very pretty by the time i’ve finished.

This is almost a copy/paste from the introdution of the webpage of this project in Odin.
In the end, will write down, about my jorney to accomplish this project, like what was more easy or more hard to do.
